# Skycards ABE Notifier

A Discord bot that monitors aircraft arrivals to help you get high scores in Skycards by alerting you about:

- ðŸ›¬ Planes landing at your chosen airports (configurable, defaults to ABE)
- ðŸ’Ž Rare aircraft notifications with rarity scoring
- âœ¨ Glowing planes and event items
- ðŸ”„ Mirrored Discord signals from Skycards announcement channels

## Features

- **Real-time Flight Monitoring**: Uses AviationStack API to monitor active flights
- **Smart Alert Window**: Only alerts 10-30 minutes before arrival (configurable)
- **Rarity System**: Shows aircraft rarity using Season-1 formula (rarity = 7.5 - ln(FTEA))
- **De-duplication**: Won't spam you with the same flight multiple times per day
- **Skycards Integration**: Mirrors rare/glow/mission announcements from official channels
- **Quiet Hours**: Optional quiet periods when no alerts are sent
- **Slash Commands**: `/watch` and `/rarity_min` for real-time adjustments

## Advanced Configuration

### Rarity System
- The bot includes pre-generated `rarity.json` and `ftea.json` from the Skycards aircraft list
- Rarity formula: `7.5 - ln(FTEA)` where FTEA = observed aircraft count
- Tiers: Ultra-rare (7.0+), Rare (5.0+), Uncommon (3.0+), Common

### Skycards Discord Integration
To get enhanced notifications from official Skycards channels:

1. Follow Skycards announcement channels into your server
2. Add the mirrored channel IDs to your `.env`:
   - `RARE_CH_ID`: Channel receiving rare aircraft posts
   - `GLOW_CH_ID`: Channel receiving glow aircraft posts  
   - `MISSION_CH_ID`: Channel receiving daily mission posts

### Alert Tuning
- `ALERT_MINUTES_MIN/MAX`: Adjust alert window (default: 10-30 minutes)
- `MIN_RARITY`: Filter out common aircraft (0.0 = all, 5.0 = rare+, 7.0 = ultra only)
- `QUIET_START/END`: Set quiet hours (24-hour format)

## Files

- `bot.py`: Main bot with Discord integration and flight monitoring
- `alert_window.py`: ETA calculations and deduplication logic
- `rarity.py`: Aircraft rarity lookup and tier classification
- `alerts_sources.py`: Parses mirrored Skycards Discord posts
- `build_rarity_json.py`: Converts aircraft CSV to JSON (one-time setup)
- `rarity.json`/`ftea.json`: Pre-generated aircraft rarity data

## Slash Commands

- `/watch <min> <max>`: Adjust alert window in minutes
- `/rarity_min <value>`: Set minimum rarity threshold

## Troubleshooting

- **No alerts**: Check your AviationStack API key and make sure flights are active to your airport
- **Bot offline**: Verify Discord bot token and permissions
- **Wrong airport**: Update `TARGET_AIRPORT_IATA` in `.env`
- **Too many alerts**: Increase `MIN_RARITY` or adjust alert window
