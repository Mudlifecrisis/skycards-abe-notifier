I have a handoff spec to extend a Discord flight bot into a Skycards ABE notifier with rarity and mirrored Discord signals. Please create the project exactly as described, generating the files and code blocks provided (bot.py, alert_window.py, rarity.py, alerts_sources.py, build_rarity_json.py, requirements.txt, .env template). Then guide me to (1) create the Discord bot/app, (2) add tokens/IDs to .env, (3) optionally convert my aircraft CSV to rarity.json/ftea.json, (4) run the bot, and (5) follow the Skycards announcement channels into my server and plug their channel IDs into .env. After running, help me verify alerts and tweak MIN_RARITY and watch window.‚Äù I created a folder which you have access to here, "C:\Projects\GitHub-Repos\Skycards-Project"  lets make a GitHub which you also have access to so we can save all our progress as we go. Please ask me any questions or bring up any ideas you think would be good. Again, this is a project to help me get high scores in Skycards by notifying me of planes landing at whatever airports I choose and also notifying me of rare planes and glowing planes and event items from the notifications on their discord, but somehow in our discord. What do you think? I have a handoff file of the work I already did with important information from another AI, once you read this just prompt just ask for it.
